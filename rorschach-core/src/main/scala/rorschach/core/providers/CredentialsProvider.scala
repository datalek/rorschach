 * A provider for authenticating with credentials.

 * The provider supports the change of password hashing algorithms on the fly. Sometimes it may be possible to change
 * the hashing algorithm used by the application. But the hashes stored in the backing store can't be converted back
 * into plain text passwords, to hash them again with the new algorithm. So if a user successfully authenticates after
 * the application has changed the hashing algorithm, the provider hashes the entered password again with the new
 * algorithm and stores the auth info in the backing store.
 *
 * @param authInfoService The auth info Service.
 * @param passwordHasher The default password hasher used by the application.
 * @param passwordHasherList List of password hasher supported by the application.
 * @param executionContext The execution context to handle the asynchronous operations.
